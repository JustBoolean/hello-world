First github reprository. Introduction and brief overlay of potential projects/ideas.

Hello My name is Abraham, a student at UWM. I enjoy Java(my first language I learned and most adept at), Javascript, Python and Assembly. I enjoy learning about new innovations and breakthroughs as well as making new like-minded coding friends. I plan on posting mainly side projects to reinforce my learning or school projects that I have expanded upon.
